Capstone Project - Python for Data Science
Problem Description
Your company got a project to analyze and create predictive models for fuel economy of cars. Fuel
economy data are the result of vehicle testing done at the Environmental Protection Agency's
National Vehicle and Fuel Emissions Laboratory in Ann Arbor, Michigan, and by vehicle
manufacturers with oversight by EPA.
Analysis has to be done on the data from 2008 to 2018. You can download the data using EPA
Green Vehicle Guide - Datafile3 and data description

Problem 1
You as the part of project have to explore, analyze and treat the data for the below mentioned

1) number of columns in each dataset
2) duplicate rows in each dataset
3) datatypes of columns
4) features with missing values
5) number of non-null unique values for features in each dataset
6) what those unique values are and counts for each

Problem 2 

Draw conclusions by creating visuals to communicate the unique models which are using different types of fuel alternatives.
